1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides means for
   network applications to obtain network information.  For example, the
   Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) defined by ALTO in [RFC7285] can provide
   the network costs of data transmissions from a set of sources to a
   set of destinations.  These costs are the distances that Rucio need,
   to select data sources or destinations, where Rucio is the de facto
   data orchestration system of CERN experiments.  In the initial ALTO
   protocol, the costs were called distances.

   In the definitions of ALTO services ([RFC7285] and existing
   extensions), there is no requirement on whether the source and the
   destination endpoints must belong to the same autonomous network,
   which is a single-domain setting, or they can belong to different
   autonomous networks, which is a multi-domain setting.  The
   unification of a single interface covering both single-domain and
   multi-domain settings provides a simple-to-use interface to ALTO
   clients.  However, it leaves standardization gaps in multi-domain
   settings.  Although participating autonomous systems can define
   private mechanisms to realize ALTO services in multi-domain settings,
   standard mechanisms allow wider deployment.

   The rest of the document first specifies the issues that may arise in
   a multi-domain settings.  It then provides initial designs, based on
   current implementation experiences to start the design conversation.
   To be concrete, this document is based on the basic ALTO ECS service.
   Additional complexities such as network maps and cost maps will be
   discussed in the next iteration.
