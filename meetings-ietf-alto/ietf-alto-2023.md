Motoyoshi:
Preparation of a presentation regarding "Secure Trusted Networks" for the next IETF Bits & Bytes.

Roland:
Still working on ALTO new transport, no major updates compared to meeting last week.

Chunshan (chunshan.xiong@cictmobile.com):
Background information on 5G in China, 5G service is currently not heavily used and operators want
to push the usage of 5G network. Segment Routing (SR) will be deployed and the 5G capabilities are increased
for use case like gaming. 
Question: What is the relevant capability of SR that is beneficial for this use cases?
Answer: Helping to reduce bandwidth for real-time communication. 

*Start Discussion:*

Discussion on congestion and congestion prediciton and estimation of capacity on the path and if it is inline
with the ALTO bottleneck discussion in this group.

Congestion Control -> impact on RTT

Bottleneck Structure -> predict future behaviour

More offline-discussion is needed for clarification.

*End Discussion:*

Lauren:
Open-ALTO project came up with requirements on Multi-Domain.
e.g., easy to use, stable design, correctness.
Suggestions of the group regarding the requirements is welcome.
Ambition is to demonstrate for Rucio.
Write a paper and go to IRTF.
Pseudo-Code is available and can by shared.

Qin:
Not ready to go for re-chartering and need to finish already chartered items first.
New Transport still requires a revision.

Mahdi:
OAM still needs some updates and comments.

=> prioritisation of chartered items is necessary.
